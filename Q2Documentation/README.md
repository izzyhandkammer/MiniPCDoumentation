# Home Lab Deliverables: KSO Project Documentation
The second phase will focus on modernizing the lab environment by migrating management to Strata Cloud Manager (SCM), leveraging $\text{AIOps}$, and implementing advanced external threat intelligence.

1. [Configure Security Profiles and apply them to policies](KSOs.md)
2. [Have an existing panorama-managed firewall (hw or vm) migrated to and managed by SCM](KSOs.md)
3. Manage an NGFW instance using Strata Cloud Manager.
4. [Deploy IoT in an environment you manage](KSOs.md) (homelab, BYOS, etc) 
5. [Deploy and configure a PA-VM (virtual NGFW)](https://github.com/izzyhandkammer/AWS-VM-NGFW-Documentation/blob/main/Environment-Basic-Setup.md)
6. [Implement custom EDL (External Dynamic List) for threat intelligence feeds](KSOs.md)
7. [Configure application override policies](KSOs.md)
